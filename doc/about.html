<h2><strong>GUI Overview</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Config Basics</b> tab: input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>
<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>User Params</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>Out: Plots</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output display of cells and substrates</li>
</ul>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p>
This app demonstrates &quot;Volume&quot; concept in PhysiCell.
</p>


<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of a course on computational multicellular systems biology created and taught by 
    Dr. Paul Macklin in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. It is also part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>: 
    a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology [1].</p>

<h2><strong> Volume </strong> </h2>
<p>
Cells, as the basic unit of life, have microscopically small dimensions. However, even these small measurements can impact cell mechanics. PhysiCell has special variables and functions that determine various aspects of cell volume.
</p>

<h2><strong> Volume Parameters </strong> </h2>
<p>
Volume parameters are assumed to be in micrometers cubed.  It is also important to note the PhysiCell doesnot link volume and radius parameters together, so both parameters need to be manually updated by theuser if there is a change to either
</p>
<h3> total </h3>
<p>
&quot;total&quot; is the value for the volume of the whole cell.
</p>
<h3> solid </h3>
<p>
&quot;total&quot; is the value for the volume of the whole cell.
</p>







<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Basic instructions</a></h2>

<p>Modify parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot;, &quot;Microenvironment&quot;, or &quot;User Params&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab, and move the slider bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;# cell frames&quot; field will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>If there are multiple substrates defined in the Microenvironment, you can select a different one from the drop-down widget in the Plots tab. You can also fix the colormap range of values.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
